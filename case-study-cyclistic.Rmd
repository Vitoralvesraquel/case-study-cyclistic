# case-study-cyclistic

Case study for Google Data Analytics Certificate's capstone project.

### Initial considerations

Annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.

The insights from the analysis could clarify the differences between annual members and casual riders to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Understand how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. 

### Data

The original data is available at: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
The data licence can be found here: https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement

The data was collected by the company and was organized for this analysis in a directory to keep the original data unchanged. Each month has a subdirectory 
containing a CSV file, comprehending the last 12 months, from June 2021 to May 
2022.

### Process Data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Make a list of the csv files inside the directory with original data.
Apply read_csv function to all files in the list.

```{r message=FALSE}
full_df_list <- list.files(path = "Data/Original", pattern = ".csv", 
                      full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE) %>% 
    lapply(read_csv)
```

Count total number of rows in the list.

```{r}
sum_rows_list <- sum(sapply(full_df_list, nrow))
sum_rows_list
```

Combine all data from the list. Compare the number of rows in the list with the
number of rows in the new dataframe to verify that all rows were combined.

```{r}
full_df <- bind_rows(full_df_list)
sum_rows_list == nrow(full_df)

```
